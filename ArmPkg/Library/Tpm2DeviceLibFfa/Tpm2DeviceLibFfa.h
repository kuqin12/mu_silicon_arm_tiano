  Provides function interfaces to communicate with TPM 2.0 device

  This library helps to use TPM 2.0 device in library function API
  based on SMC using Command Response Buffer (CRB).

  The TPM2DeviceLib library is sitting at the bottom of the TPM stack in UEFI.
  It is responsible for sending and receiving commands to and from the TPM.

  This TPM library performs the following actions:

  1) Receives a TPM command from the upper TPM layers.
  2) Moves the TPM command into the Command/Response Buffer (CRB).
    a) The address of the CRB is received through:
        gEfiSecurityPkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdTpmBaseAddress
    b) The interface to the CRB is described in:
        https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Command-Response-Buffer-Interface-v2-r12-Specification_FINAL2.pdf
  3) Set the CRB start bit to indicate that a TPM command is sitting in the CRB.
  4) Execute an SMC instruction to transfer execution to the Secure Monitor in EL3.
  4) The CRB/TPM command moves through the following components:
      NS -> SP -> TPM
  5) After returning from the SMC instruction the TPM command has been processed.
  6) Check status codes etc.
  7) Read the response length from the CRB and copy the response into the output buffer delivered with the TPM command.
  8) Return back to the upper layers of the TPM stack.

  This module is only to be used during boot. This will not persist after exit boot services is called.
